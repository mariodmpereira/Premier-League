    <p>The Premier League (often referred to as the English Premier League (EPL) outside England) is the top level of
      the English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation
      with the English Football League (EFL).</p>
    <p>The Premier League is a corporation in which the member clubs act as shareholders. Seasons run from August to
      May with each team playing 38 matches (playing all 19 other teams both home and away). Most games are played on
      Saturday and Sunday afternoons. The Premier League has featured 47 English and two Welsh clubs since its
      inception, making it a cross-border league.</p>
    <p>The competition was formed as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the
      Football League First Division to brgieak away from the Football League, founded in 1888, and take advantage of a
      lucrative television rights deal. The deal was worth £1 billion a year domestically as of 2013–14, with Sky and
      BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 116 and 38 games respectively. The league generates €2.2
      billion per year in domestic and international television rights. Clubs were apportioned central payment
      revenues of £2.4 billion in 2016–17, with a further £343 million in solidarity payments to English Football
      League (EFL) clubs.</p>
    <p>The Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million
      homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people. In the 2014–15 season, the average Premier League match
      attendance exceeded 36,000, second highest of any professional football league behind the Bundesliga's 43,500.
      Most stadium occupancies are near capacity. The Premier League ranks second in the UEFA coefficients of leagues
      based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons, as of 2018.</p>
